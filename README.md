Click on the corners of a book on the bottom image. When all 4 corners have been selected 
the book will be added to the list of books at the bottom of the page. Above each book 
is the dominant color of that book. The list is sorted to reduce the distance between the
dominant colors. Support for multiple shelves and shelf length will be coming soon. Possible
support for automatic detection of books may come depending on how hard hough transformations 
are to write.
